I specialize in Applied NLP, with a focus on adapting language models to real-world tasks. Currently, I work on finding ways to make LLMs work for Real World Data (RWD) to power cancer diagnosis, treatment planning and clinical trial matching. Previously, at **Harvard Medical School** and **Boston Children's Hospital**, I designed weakly supervised, domain-adaptive models to assist surgical decision-making in low-resource clinical settings.

I received my MS in Computer Science from **UMass Amherst**, where I was part of the **IESL Lab**, working on continual learning and language generation. Before that, I got my Bachelors in Information Systems from **Singapore Management University**, where I first learned how to blend technical research with real-world product thinking.
